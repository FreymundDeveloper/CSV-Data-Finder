About the application and specified requirements:

* Backend localhost:3000;

* Frontend localhost:4000;

* Scripts specifications (npm run dev, npm run test, npm install);

* Routes EndPoints [POST /api/files] and [GET /api/users];

* back-to-front integration;

* Authomated Tests(After the time out);
...

I know I'm already eliminated, because ~~I couldn't develop the automated tests~~, considering that I never applied them through typescript.

...

Thanks for the challenge, it was a great learning experience!
