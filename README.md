The application if specified requirements:

* Backend localhost on port 3000;

* Frontend localhost on port 4000;

* Scripts specifications (npm run dev, npm run test, npm install);

* Routes EndPoints;

...

I know I'm already eliminated, because I couldn't develop the automated tests, considering that I never applied them through typescript.

...

Thanks for the challenge, it was a great learning experience!
